### How to Play:

Both players enter their names. After submitting, click the start button when player one is ready.

Using your mouse or finger, find the fly and click on it to earn a point.

Each player has 15 seconds to swat the fly as best as they can. 

The player with the most successful "swats" [points] is declared the winner. The winner has 10 seconds to gloat and the game will restart.
